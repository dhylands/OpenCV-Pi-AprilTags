# AprilTag detector running on the Raspberry Pi using OpenCV

This is cobbled together by adapting and updating the following blog posts:
[Detecting ArUco markers with OpenCV and Python](https://pyimagesearch.com/2020/12/21/detecting-aruco-markers-with-opencv-and-python/)
and [OpenCV â€“ Stream video to web browser/HTML page](https://pyimagesearch.com/2019/09/02/opencv-stream-video-to-web-browser-html-page/)

It runs a flask server on the Pi, serves up the camera as a video stream and hilights
AprilTags found in the video stream.

An example of it running can be found [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VYorsbjxdzmJn2f19)
